*Using `cd` , `ls` , and `cat`.*

**An example of using the command with no arguments:**
* `cd` :

![Image](cd no args.png)

When you use `cd` with no arguments the working directory will change to become the home directory.
In this example it will appear that nothing has changed as the working directory *was* the home directory prior
to the use of `cd` with no arguments. For example, if the working directory was lecture1 it, the use of `cd` with 
no arguments would result in the working directory changing to be the home directory, in this case /home.
* `ls` :
  
![Image](ls no args.png)

* `cat` :
  
![Image](cat no args.png)

cntrl c to x out, cat waiting for arg -long running prgrm, no change to 
working dir, outout not error per say -doing what its supposed to, but it does not perform
its function

**An example of using the command with a path to a directory as an argument:**
* `cd` :
  
![Image](cd dir arg.png)

* `ls` :
  
![Image](ls dir arg.png)

* `cat` :
  
![Image](cat dir arg.png)


**An example of using the command with a path to a file as an argument:**
* `cd` :
  
![Image](cd file arg.png)

* `ls` :
  
![Image](ls file arg.png)

* `cat` :
  
![Image](cat file arg.png)
